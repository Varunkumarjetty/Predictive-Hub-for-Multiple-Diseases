As a student from the healthcare domain, I have deployed an *End to End machine* learning project that predicts the likelihood of three diseases in a single destination. The project, which was developed using *Stream lit*, is capable of predicting the probability of diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease using data sets that I have picked up from Kaggle



The project has undoubtedly been a challenging task, requiring a high level of expertise and knowledge in both healthcare and machine learning. However, through perseverance and hard work, have managed to build a successful prediction system that can be used to identify individuals at risk of developing these diseases.



*Diabetes dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set

Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that occurs when the body cannot produce or effectively use insulin, leading to high levels of glucose in the blood.



*Heart Disease Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishidamarla/heart-disease-prediction

Heart disease, on the other hand, is a broad term that refers to any condition that affects the heart, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias.



*Parkinson's Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debasisdotcom/parkinson-disease-detection

Finally, Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement and is characterized by tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with coordination.
